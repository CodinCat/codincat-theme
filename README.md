This color scheme uses more warm and lower brightness colors, which should be easy on your eyes. (It may look a little bit yellow (or *dirty*), this is intended.)

Contains 3 themes (Default, Dimmed and Lighter) that based on the same color scheme. Choose the one that fits your screen setting and your preference.

Recommended fonts: [Fira Mono](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/), [Input](http://input.fontbureau.com/) (the font of the screenshot above) or [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack).

I'll also recommend the [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) app.
